# Software Engineering: Summative Assignment 1

## _Due: 26th April 2024_

### **1**: The proposed project
* **What?**: To create an easy to use postcode product that allows for key electoral and geographic information to be identified.
* **Why?**: When handling large datasets in SQL, it is easy to extract postcode information by joining the table of interest with the postcode lookup. However, our case managers are often interested in looking up a single postcode (perhaps for a college or idependent training provider). For this, there currently is not tool widely adopted in the department. The tool aims to be a reliable and easy-to-use tool for case managers to get postcode / geographic information.

### **2**: The design
* **Considerations**
> * **Colour palette**: All colours used within this design are from the GDS colour scheme. These have been chosen with accessibility in mind. They have high-contrast to ensure they are suitable for those with colour deficiency. Furthermore, they are designed to be bright so that even in sub-optimal lighting, they should remain visible. Colour codes are publicly [available](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/styles/colour/).
> * **Aspect ratio**: Employees within the department are issued a device from a narrow list of devices. Therefore, the frame used for the design was selected to have the same resolution and aspect ratio. This provides the most realistic representation of this app will look like.
> * **Components**: Within the GDS style guide, button are typically selected depending on the context of which they are used. This provides a consistent experience across all government products and users should intuively know what this Based on the GDS style guide, the default button was added to the design here. The rationale is this the button does not change the page but does perform the main action of this page - to lookup the postcode.

#### **2.1**: Feedback collection
* To collect feedback on this initial design, a feedback form was used. The data collection was annonymous so that users have confidence to provide genuine feedback, without being worried out judgment.

Questions 1 - 2 | Question 3 - 4

#### **2.2**: Further improvements
* Whilst this document is principally concerned with the development of the a minimum viable product (MVP), the feedback shed light on improvements that should be considered for future improvements.
* These included:
> * Consider other device types. It is becoming increasingly common for front-line colleagues to work on the road and use their phones for tasks. Therefore, a mobile-optimised app would be useful.
> * It is common for colleagues to be multi-tasking and have two tabs side by side. Therefore, it would be useful to have a responsive layout that changes the layout from horizontal to vertical below a certain width.
