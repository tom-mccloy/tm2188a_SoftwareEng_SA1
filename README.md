### **1**: The proposed project
* **What?**: To create an easy to use postcode product that allows for key electoral and geographic information to be identified.
* **Why?**: When handling large datasets in SQL, it is easy to extract postcode information by joining the table of interest with the postcode lookup. However, our case managers are often interested in looking up a single postcode (perhaps for a college or idependent training provider). For this, there currently is not tool widely adopted in the department. The tool aims to be a reliable and easy-to-use tool for case managers to get postcode / geographic information.
